Idea:
use python most famous library for SVM, NN...

1) Learn how to use library (on MONK data set)
library:
    -Pytorch 
    -scikit-learn
    -keras
    -tensorflow maibe
    -cafe2 maibe
algorthms:
    -SVM with scikit and pytorch
    -NN with pytorch an keras
    -Linear regression for comparison
    -AdaBoost (boost in general) maibe
    -Bayesan naive maibe
hyperparameter chosing

2) We study again and implement validation!! very impportant!


3) Experiment and result (!hyperparameters turning)

NOTE:
save everything we discover
write comments about it and save plots
